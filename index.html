			<p id="text-top20-1">Residents of Andorra, a small European country bordering France and Spain, drink the most, averaging 695 servings per year. That's about 2 drinks a day!
				<br><br>And while most other countries in the top 20 are similarly European countries, the type of alcohol residents are drinking vary quite a bit by country.</p>
			<p id="text-top20-2">Some countries primarily drink beer, like Czech Republic and Lithuania. France, unsurprisingly, mostly drinks wine - so does Portugal. And residents of Grenada tend to prefer spirits.</p>

			<p id="text-top20-1">Here are the top 20 countries that consume the most alcohol and the number of servings the average person drinks in a year. <br><br>Residents of Andorra, a small European country bordering France and Spain, drink the most, averaging 695 servings per year. That's about 2 drinks a day! <br><br>And while most other countries in the top 20 are similarly European countries, the type of alcohol residents are drinking vary quite a bit by country.</p>
      <p id="text-top20-2">Residents in some countries primarily drink beer, like the Czech Republic and Lithuania. <br><br>The French, unsurprisingly, mostly drinks wine - and so do people in Portugal. <br><br>And residents of Grenada tend to prefer spirits over beer or wine. <br><br>But are these the countries whose residents consume the most of each drink?</p>
      <p id="text-top20-3">Here are the top 20 countries that consume the most of each drink.
				<br><br>Namibia is the top beer-drinking country, with people consuming an average of 376 beers per year. In comparison, Germans drink 346 per year, and Americans 249.
		<br><br>People in Grenada drink the most in spirits - 438 in a year. That's over 100 drinks more than the Russians, who average 326 in a year.
		<br><br>And when it comes to wine, France comes in at the top at 370 glasses per year. And while France's yearly consumption is similarly large in comparison to the top countries for beer and spirits, consumption in its remaining top 20 quickly decrease, reaching sub-200 by country #16. In comparison, yearly consumption for all 20 countries in the beer and spirits categories remain above 200.</p>

			<p id="text-top20-1">Here are the top 20 countries that consume the most alcohol and the number of servings the average person drinks in a year. <br><br>Residents of Andorra, a small European country bordering France and Spain, drink the most, averaging 695 servings per year. That's about 2 drinks a day! <br><br>And while most other countries in the top 20 are similarly European countries, the type of alcohol residents are drinking vary quite a bit by country.</p>
      <p id="text-top20-2">Residents in some countries primarily drink beer, like the Czech Republic and Lithuania. <br><br>The French, unsurprisingly, mostly drinks wine - and so do people in Portugal. <br><br>And residents of Grenada tend to prefer spirits over beer or wine. <br><br>But are these the countries whose residents consume the most of each drink?</p>
